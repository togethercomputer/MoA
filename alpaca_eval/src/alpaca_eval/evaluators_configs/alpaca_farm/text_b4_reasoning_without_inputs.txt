We are developing a model to evaluate instructions and their corresponding outputs. Please select the output (a) or (b) that best matches the given instruction.

I will first show you a single short example (the real ones might be longer). Then I'll show you how to format the answer for multiple examples. Finally, I will ask you to choose the best outputs for new examples.

Now I will show you 4 short examples in a row and show the correct best output and formatting. I'd like you to read all of them first and provide all the best outputs at the end. Note that the answer to one example should not impact the other.
