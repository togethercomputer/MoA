Mixture of Agents (MoA) is a novel approach that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs to enhance performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. By employing a layered architecture where each layer comprises several LLM agents, MoA significantly outperforms GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% on AlpacaEval 2.0 with a score of 65.1%, using only open-source models!

## Interactive Demo

We first present an interactive demo. It showcases a simple multi-turn chatbot where the final response is aggregated from various reference models.

### Setup

1. Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the API keys (and base URLs if necessary):

   ```shell
   cp .env.example .env
   vi .env
   ```

2. Install Requirements:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Demo

To run the interactive demo, execute the following script with Python:

```shell
python bot.py
```

The script will prompt you to input instructions interactively. Here's how to use it:

1. Start by entering your instruction at the ">>>" prompt.
2. The system will process your input using the predefined reference models.
3. It will generate a response based on the aggregated outputs from these models.
4. You can continue the conversation by inputting more instructions, with the system maintaining the context of the multi-turn interaction.
5. enter `exit` to exit the chatbot.

### Configuration

You can configure the demo by specifying the following parameters:

- `--aggregator`: The primary model used for final response generation.
- `--reference_models`: List of models used as references.
- `--temperature`: Controls the randomness of the response generation.
- `--max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens in the response.
- `--rounds`: Number of rounds to process the input for refinement. (num rounds == num of MoA layers - 1)
- `--num_proc`: Number of processes to run in parallel for faster execution.
- `--multi_turn`: Boolean to toggle multi-turn interaction capability.

## Evaluation

We provide scripts to quickly reproduce some of the results presented in our paper
For convenience, we have included the code from [AlpacaEval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval),
[MT-Bench](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), and [FLASK](https://github.com/kaistAI/FLASK), with necessary modifications.
We extend our gratitude to these projects for creating the benchmarks.

### Preparation

```shell
# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd alpaca_eval
pip install -e .
cd FastChat
pip install -e ".[model_worker,llm_judge]"
cd ..

# setup api keys
export API_KEY=<API_KEY>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

### Run AlpacaEval 2

To run AlpacaEval 2, execute the following scripts:

```shell
bash run_eval_alpaca_eval.sh
```

### Run MT-Bench

For a minimal example of MT-Bench evaluation, run:

```shell
bash run_eval_mt_bench.sh
```

### Run FLASK

For a minimal example of FLASK evaluation, run:

```shell
bash run_eval_flask.sh
```

### Results

We achieved top positions on both the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard and MT-Bench. Notably, on AlpacaEval 2.0, using solely open-source models, we achieved a margin of 7.6% absolute improvement from 57.5% (GPT-4 Omni) to 65.1% (MoA).

FLASK offers fine-grained evaluation of models across multiple dimensions. Our MoA method significantly outperforms the original Qwen1.5-110B-Chat on harmlessness, robustness, correctness, efficiency, factuality, common sense, insightfulness, completeness. Additionally, MoA also outperforms GPT-4 Omni in terms of correctness, factuality, insightfulness, completeness, and meta-cognition.

Please feel free to contact us if you have difficulties in reproducing the results.
